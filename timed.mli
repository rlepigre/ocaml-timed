(** Timed references for imperative state. This module provides an alternative
    type for references (or mutable cells) supporting undo/redo operations. In
    particular, an abstract notion of time is used to capture the state of the
    references at any given point, so that it can be restored. Note that usual
    reference operations only have a constant time / memory overhead (compared
    to those of {!module:Stdlib}).

(** Note that this module allocates two blocks of memory at initialization for
    its internal state. They occupy a total of six words. *)

(** Type of references similar to {!type:Stdlib.ref}.  Note that it uses three
    words of memory, while {!type:Stdlib.ref} uses two. Importantly, note that
    it is {b unsafe to marshal}  elements of this type using functions of  the
    {!module:Marshal} module or {!val:Stdlib.output_value}.  It is possible to
    work around this limitation using {!val:unsafe_reset}. *)
type 'a ref

(** [ref v] creates a new reference holding the value [v]. This operation runs
    in constant time, and has a very small (even negligible) overhead compared
    to {!val:Stdlib.ref}. This function allocates one block of memory of three
    words (against two for {!type:Stdlib.ref}). *)
val ref : 'a -> 'a ref

(** [!r] returns the current value of [r]. This operation is constant time and
    has a negligible overhead compared to {!val:Stdlib.(!)}. Moreover, it does
    not perform any memory allocation. *)
val (!) : 'a ref -> 'a

(** [r := v] sets the value of the reference [r] to [v].  This operation has a
    very small overhead compared to {!val:Stdlib.(:=)} when no time  has  been
    saved with {!val:Time.save}. Nonetheless, it is always constant time. Note
    that this function does not perform any memory allocation, except when the
    current “time” is accessible (or has not been collected) and [r] is  being
    updated for the first time in the current “time”. If that is the case, two
    blocks of memory are allocated, for a total of six words. *)
val (:=) : 'a ref -> 'a -> unit

(** [incr r] is equivalent to [r := !r + 1]. *)
val incr : int ref -> unit

(** [decr r] is equivalent to [r := !r - 1]. *)
val decr : int ref -> unit

(** The [Time] module provides an abstract representation of time, used to set
    a point from which updates to references are recorded to allow undoing (of
    redoing) the corresponding changes. *)
module Time :
  sig
    (** Point in the “timeline” of the program's execution. *)
    type t

    (** [save ()] registers the position of the program in its “timeline”. The
        returned value can then be used to “time-travel” toward this point, by
        calling {!val:restore}. The saving operation runs in constant time. In
        the process one block of memory of three words is allocated. Note that
        two consecutive calls to [save] (i.e., with no interleaved {!val:(:=)}
        or {!val:restore}) return the same value,  and the second one does not
        allocate any memory. *)
    val save : unit -> t

    (** Note that when a saved “time” becomes unaccessible,  memory previously
        allocated by {!val:(:=)} may itself become unaccessible if none of the
        remaining saved “times” can undo the corresponding updates. If that is
        the case, the memory related to these update is collected.  The memory
        footprint of the library is thus minimal. *)

    (** [restore t] has the effect of “traveling in time” towards a previously
        recorded point [t]. After calling this function, the reference updates
        made between [t] and the “time before the call” are undone.  Note that
        this is the only basic operation that is not constant time. Complexity
        (time and space) is discussed below. *)
    val restore : t -> unit

    (** The time complexity of {!val:restore} is O(MT) where:
          - M is the maximum number of different references that were updated
            between two consecutive calls to {!val:save}.
          - T is the number of saved time between t and the current time.
        The number of memory blocks allocated by the {!val:restore} function
        is proportional to the above T.

        A better expression of its time complexity is “Σ Mₖtₖ” (for 0 ≤ k < n)
        where tₖ is the k-th (saved) time between t = t₀ and current time  tₙ,
        and Mₖ is the number of different updated references between the times
        tₖ and tₖ₊₁. *)
  end

(** [pure_apply f v] computes the result of [f v],  but reverts the updates to
    references before returning the value. *)
val pure_apply : ('a -> 'b) -> 'a -> 'b

(** [pure_test p v] applies the predicate [p] to [v] (i.e., compute [p v]) and
    returns the result,  reverting the updates made to reference if the result
    is [false]. Updates are preserved if the result is [true]. *)
val pure_test : ('a -> bool) -> 'a -> bool

(** [unsafe_reset r] can be used to work around the marshaling limitations. In
    fact, there is no problem marshaling data structures containing references
    (i.e.,  values of type {!type:ref}).  However,  unmarshaling such a  value
    will leave it in an inconsistent state with respect to the library. Hence,
    it is {b absolutely necessary} to call [unsafe_reset] on every element  of
    type {!type:ref} in an unmarshaled value.  Doing so will make  the  system
    believe that the reference has just been created. Note that [unsafe_reset]
    {b should not be used in any other situation}, and especially if the given
    [r] has already been updated with {!val:(:=)}. *)
val unsafe_reset : 'a ref -> unit
